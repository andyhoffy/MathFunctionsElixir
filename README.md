# MathFunctions

This is a code exercise to implement the following math functions:

- Min
- Max
- Average
- Mode

The goal is to implement them in the lowest level possible without making use of built-in functions.

## Usage

You can run this from `iex` like so:

```
$ iex -S mix
$ iex(1)> MathFunctions.min([5, 2, 3])
$ 2
```

See a detailed view of the test results by running:

```
$ mix test --trace
```
